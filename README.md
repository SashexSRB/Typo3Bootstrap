# TYPO3 Project Setup Script

This script helps you quickly create a new TYPO3 project using DDEV. It checks that all required tools are installed, asks you for a unique project name, sets up TYPO3 automatically, and optionally creates a basic extension structure. Just run the script and follow the prompts — it handles the rest for you.
